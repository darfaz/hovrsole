        <h3>2. Product Description</h3>
        <p>HOVRSOLE is patent-pending internal suspension footwear designed for performance and protective use. HOVRSOLE is <strong>not a medical device</strong> and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition. No FDA approval is required or claimed.
